  <h2> Determinants of Real Estate Investment</h2>
  <h3>The specificity of investments in property</h3>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li> Land kept to obtain long term profits resulting from increases in its value.</li>
      <li> Land kept without any specified designation, which is recognized as an investment to obtain an increase in its value.</li>
      <li> Building which the entity keeps in order to be rented.</li>
    </ul>
  As mentioned above, investments should be considered as assets
  acquired in order to obtain economic profits resulting from the increased
  value of those assets. Investment in property may be done by direct or
  indirect means. Indirect investment involves obtaining an investment
  certificate and participating investment fund entities on the one hand,
  capital engagement on the other; whereas, direct investment is related
  to property purchase in order to obtain current profits in the form of
  tenancy rents, or as a result of waiting for the value of the investment
  subject to increase.
